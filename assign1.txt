CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid: CSS Flexbox: Purpose: Flexbox is a one-dimensional
layout model, ideal for arranging items in a single row or column. 
Usage: It's great for creating flexible and dynamic layouts, especially for elements in a
single direction (row or column).

Example: 
Used for navigation menus, lists, or elements within a container where you need
items to flexibly adjust their size based on available space. 


CSS Grid: 
Purpose: 
Grid is a two-dimensional layout system, allowing for both rows and columns
simultaneously. Usage: Best suited for creating complex layouts with rows and
columns, providing precise control over the placement of items. 

Example: 
Great for creating overall page layouts, including header, main content,
sidebars, and footers in a structured grid format. 
When to Choose: 
Flexbox is great for simpler, one-dimensional layouts where elements flow in a
single direction (row or column). Grid is more powerful for complex layouts with
both rows and columns, providing fine-grained control over the positioning of
items. Choosing Between Them: Use Flexbox when dealing with smaller-scale
layouts, or when your layout primarily involves elements in a single direction.
Use Grid when dealing with larger-scale layouts, or when your design requires
more complex and structured arrangements of rows and columns.

They Work Together: Combining both Flexbox and Grid is also common.
You might use Flexbox for items within a grid cell to further control their
arrangement in a specific direction. The choice between Flexbox and Grid depends
on the layout requirements of your project. In many cases, they complement each
other, and using both in different parts of your design can provide a flexible
and robust layout system.
